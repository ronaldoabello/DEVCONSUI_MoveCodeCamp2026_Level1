## Welcome

Welcome to the **DEVCON x Sui Move Smart Contracts Code Camp!**

In this hands-on session, you will build and deploy your own decentralized portfolio application on the **Sui blockchain**. By the end of the workshop, you will have a live website that reads data from a smart contract you wrote and deployed yourself.

No prior blockchain experience is required. Just bring your laptop and follow along step by step.

---

## What is Sui?

Sui is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain built by Mysten Labs — the team behind Meta's Diem project. It uses an **object-centric model** that allows transactions to run in parallel, making it extremely fast and scalable. Move is its smart contract language, designed for safety and clarity.

---

## Pre-Installation Notice (Partner Schools)

If you are attending at a **partner school workstation**, the tools below are already installed. Skip to **Step 2: Create Your Accounts** and proceed from there.

---

## Step 1 — Install Required Tools

> ⚠️ **This is the only step that uses a separate Administrator PowerShell window.** After Step 1 is complete, close that window. All commands from Step 2 onwards are run in the **VS Code terminal**.

### 1A. Open PowerShell as Administrator

Click Start → search **PowerShell** → right-click → **Run as Administrator**

### 1B. Install Chocolatey

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Wait for it to finish.

### 1C. Install Node.js, Git, and Sui

```powershell
choco install nodejs-lts git sui -y
```

Wait for all three to finish installing.

### 1D. Verify installation

Close and reopen PowerShell, then run:

```powershell
node --version
git --version
sui --version
```

All three should print a version number. If any says "not recognized", close and reopen PowerShell. If the issue persists, restart your computer.

> ✅ **Step 1 complete.** Close this Administrator PowerShell window. Open VS Code and use its built-in terminal (**Terminal → New Terminal**) for all remaining steps.

---

## Step 2 — Create Your Accounts

> 🖥️ **No terminal commands in this step.**

You need two accounts for this workshop:

| Account | Purpose | Link |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub** | Store your project files | https://github.com |
| **Vercel** | Host your live website | https://vercel.com |

**Action:** Create or sign in to GitHub first. Then go to Vercel and sign in **using your GitHub account** — this connects them automatically.

---

## Step 3 — Configure the Sui Client

> 🖥️ **Run these commands in the VS Code terminal** (`Terminal → New Terminal`).

This sets up your blockchain wallet on your computer. Run:

```powershell
sui client addresses
```

Follow the prompts:

| Prompt | What to do |
|---|---|
| Connect to a Sui Full node? | Type `y` then press Enter |
| Sui Full node URL | Press **Enter** to accept the default (Testnet) |
| Key scheme | Type `0` and press Enter (selects ed25519) |

After setup, the terminal will show a **Secret Recovery Phrase** and a **Wallet Address**.

> ⚠️ **Save both in Notepad immediately.** Your recovery phrase cannot be recovered if lost.

---

## Step 4 — Fork and Clone the Repository

> 🖥️ **Clone command is run in the VS Code terminal.**

### Fork on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/ldcasilang/DEVCONSUI_MoveCodeCamp2026_Level1
2. Click **Fork** (top-right corner)
3. In **Repository name**, add your surname at the end:
   ```
   DEVCONSUI_MoveCodeCamp2026_Level1_YourSurname
   ```
4. Click **Create fork**

### Clone to Your Computer

In the **VS Code terminal**, run:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DEVCONSUI_MoveCodeCamp2026_Level1_YourSurname.git
```

Navigate into the project folder:

```powershell
cd DEVCONSUI_MoveCodeCamp2026_Level1_YourSurname
```

Open the project in VS Code:

```powershell
code .
```

> This opens the entire project in VS Code. You will do all your editing here.

---

## Step 5 — Publish the Smart Contract to Mainnet

> 🖥️ **Run all commands in this step in the VS Code terminal.**

### Switch to Mainnet

Run these two commands one at a time:

```powershell
sui client new-env --alias mainnet --rpc https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443
```

```powershell
sui client switch --env mainnet
```

### Get Your Wallet Address

```powershell
sui client active-address
```

Copy the address shown and save it in Notepad.

### Obtain Mainnet SUI Tokens

You need a small amount of real SUI to pay for deployment gas (approx. 0.012 SUI).

1. Go to https://www.qr-code-generator.com/
2. Paste your wallet address and generate a QR code
3. Show the QR code to a mentor — they will send you the SUI tokens needed

### Check Your Balance

```powershell
sui client balance
```

Wait until it shows at least **0.05 SUI** before continuing.

### Build the Smart Contract

Navigate to the contract folder:

```powershell
cd portfolio_contract
```

Build:

```powershell
sui move build
```

> If it seems to hang for more than 2 minutes, press `Ctrl + C` and run `sui move build` again.

If you see a build error mentioning `.move` cache, clean it first:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.move"
```

Then run `sui move build` again.

### Publish to Mainnet

```powershell
sui client publish
```

After it finishes, look through the output for a line that says **PackageID**:

```
PackageID: 0xabc123...
```

> ⚠️ **Save this PackageID in Notepad now.** You will need it in the next step.

---

## Step 6 — Deploy Your Portfolio Object

> 🖥️ **Run all commands in this step in the VS Code terminal.**

This step puts your personal information onto the blockchain as a Sui object.

### Add Your Profile Photo

1. Find the photo you want to use on your computer (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, or `.webp`)
2. In VS Code, open the **Explorer panel** on the left sidebar
3. Navigate to `portfolio_frontend` → `public`
4. **Drag your photo file** from File Explorer into the `public` folder in VS Code
5. Right-click the file you just added → **Rename** → rename it to `profile.png`

> The app is set up to look for `profile.png`. If you use a different format, still rename it to `profile.png`.

### Deploy Your Personal Portfolio

Run the command below in the **VS Code terminal**. **Replace all the placeholder values** with your own information.

> ⚠️ **PowerShell line continuation:** The backtick `` ` `` at the end of each line must be the **very last character** — no spaces after it. A trailing space will cause an "unexpected token" error.

```powershell
sui client call `
  --function create_portfolio `
  --module portfolio `
  --package <YOUR_PACKAGE_ID> `
  --args `
  "YOUR FULL NAME" `
  "Your Course" `
  "Your School" `
  "Write a short description about yourself." `
  "https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile/" `
  "https://github.com/your-username" `
  "Skill 1,Skill 2,Skill 3,Skill 4,Skill 5"
```

**Example (filled in):**

```powershell
sui client call `
  --function create_portfolio `
  --module portfolio `
  --package 0xabc123youpackageid `
  --args `
  "LADY DIANE CASILANG" `
  "BS in Information Technology" `
  "FEU Institute of Technology" `
  "I am a fourth-year IT student and freelance designer." `
  "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ldcasilang/" `
  "https://github.com/ldcasilang" `
  "Graphic Design,UI/UX Design,Project Management,Full Stack Development,Web & App Development"
```

After the command completes, look for **Object ID** (also called `objectId`) in the output.

> ⚠️ **Save this Object ID in Notepad.** This is your portfolio's on-chain address.

### Update the Frontend with Your Object ID

1. In VS Code, open:  
   `portfolio_frontend` → `src` → `constants.ts`

2. Find this line:

   ```ts
   export const MAINNET_PORTFOLIO_ID = "0xa3343391df96e28464499f4c209d51bf209c07392fdeea97bfeee59e7550f020";
   ```

3. Replace the value in quotes with **your own Object ID**:

   ```ts
   export const MAINNET_PORTFOLIO_ID = "0xYOUR_OBJECT_ID_HERE";
   ```

4. Save the file (`Ctrl + S`).

---

## Step 7 — Run the Frontend Locally

> 🖥️ **Run all commands in this step in the VS Code terminal.**

If you are still inside `portfolio_contract` from Step 5, navigate to the frontend folder with:

```powershell
cd ../portfolio_frontend
```

If you are in the project root, run:

```powershell
cd portfolio_frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

You should see your portfolio with your name and information loaded from the blockchain.

> Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal when you are done previewing.

---

## Step 8 — Push Your Changes to GitHub

> 🖥️ **Run all commands in this step in the VS Code terminal.**

Make sure you are in the root project folder. Navigate up if needed:

```powershell
cd ..
```

Check that you are in the right place (should show your repo name):

```powershell
git remote -v
```

Stage all your changes:

```powershell
git add .
```

Commit your changes:

```powershell
git commit -m "Deploy Move Smart Contract Portfolio"
```

Push to GitHub:

```powershell
git push origin main
```

### If Git Asks for Username and Password

Enter your GitHub username. For the password, you need a **Personal Access Token** (GitHub no longer accepts plain passwords):

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Token name: `Git-Push-Token`
4. Expiration: Choose a date or select **No expiration**
5. Under **Select scopes**, check **repo** (all options under it)
6. Scroll down and click **Generate token**
7. Copy the token and use it as your password in the terminal

> ⚠️ **Save this token in Notepad** — GitHub only shows it once.

---

## Step 9 — Deploy to Vercel (Live Website)

> 🖥️ **No terminal commands in this step.**

1. Go to https://vercel.com and log in with your GitHub account
2. Click **Add New Project**
3. Find your forked repository and click **Import**
4. Under **Root Directory**, click **Edit** and select `portfolio_frontend` → click **Continue**
5. Rename the project — remove the last word and replace with your surname:
   ```
   devconsui-move-code-camp2026-level1-YourSurname
   ```
6. Under **Build Command**, click **Edit** and type: `npm run build`
7. Click **Deploy**

Wait for it to finish. When done, click **Visit** to see your live site.

### Save Your Live URL

Copy your Vercel URL (looks like `https://your-project.vercel.app`). Then:

1. Go to your **forked GitHub repository**
2. Click the **gear icon** (Settings) on the right side of the About section
3. Paste your Vercel URL into the **Website** field
4. Click **Save changes**

## Troubleshooting

**`sui` is not recognized as a command**  
→ Make sure `C:\sui` is added to your PATH (see Step 1C) and that you reopened PowerShell.

**`sui move build` hangs for too long**  
→ Press `Ctrl + C`, then run `sui move build` again.

**Build error about `.move` cache**  
→ Run `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.move"` then build again.

**`npm install` fails**  
→ Make sure you are inside the `portfolio_frontend` folder. If you were in `portfolio_contract`, run `cd ../portfolio_frontend` first.

**PowerShell says "unexpected token" on the `sui client call` command**  
→ Make sure there is no trailing space after each backtick `` ` ``. It must be the very last character on the line.

**Git asks for password on push**  
→ Use a GitHub Personal Access Token as your password (see Step 8).

**Website shows old data after update**  
→ Re-run `git add .`, `git commit`, `git push`, then trigger a redeploy in Vercel.
